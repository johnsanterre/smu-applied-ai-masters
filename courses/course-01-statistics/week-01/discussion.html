            <h1>Week 1 Discussion Topics</h1>
            <p>Engage with these topics to deepen your understanding of probability foundations and their applications
                in AI and machine learning.</p>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 1: Frequentist vs. Bayesian Interpretations</h4>
                <p>The frequentist interpretation views probability as the long-run frequency of events in repeated
                    experiments, while the Bayesian interpretation treats probability as a degree of belief that can be
                    updated with evidence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider the statement: "There is a 30% chance it will rain tomorrow." How would a frequentist
                        interpret this? How would a Bayesian?</li>
                    <li>Which interpretation seems more natural for AI systems that need to make decisions under
                        uncertainty?</li>
                    <li>Can you think of scenarios where one interpretation is clearly more appropriate than the other?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 2: Probability in AI Decision Making</h4>
                <p>Modern AI systems, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis tools, must make decisions under
                    uncertainty using probabilistic reasoning.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How might an autonomous vehicle use probability theory to decide whether to proceed through a
                        yellow light?</li>
                    <li>What are the ethical implications of AI systems making probabilistic decisions that affect human
                        lives?</li>
                    <li>Should AI systems be required to explain their probabilistic reasoning to users?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 3: The Role of Sample Spaces in Problem Formulation</h4>
                <p>Correctly defining the sample space is crucial for accurate probability calculations. Different
                    formulations can lead to different answers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider the classic "Two Children Problem": A family has two children. Given that at least one
                        is a boy, what is the probability both are boys? Why does the answer depend on how you define
                        the sample space?</li>
                    <li>How might ML practitioners accidentally define sample spaces incorrectly when building models,
                        and what problems could this cause?</li>
                    <li>Can you think of a real-world AI application where sample space definition significantly impacts
                        results?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 4: Limitations of Classical Probability</h4>
                <p>Not all uncertain situations fit neatly into the classical probability framework.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How would you assign a probability to "the next major AI breakthrough will occur within 5
                        years"? What challenges arise?</li>
                    <li>Some researchers argue that "deep uncertainty" cannot be captured by probability. What might
                        this mean, and how should AI systems handle it?</li>
                    <li>Discuss the difference between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (unknown
                        distributions) in the context of AI safety.</li>
                </ul>
