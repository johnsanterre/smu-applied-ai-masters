                "A": "An event is actually a subset of the sample space, not a single outcome. A single outcome is called an elementary event or sample point.",
                "B": "The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, not the event itself. The event is the set of outcomes we are measuring.",
                "C": "Correct! An event is any subset of the sample space. It can contain zero, one, or multiple outcomes. For example, when rolling a die, \"rolling an even number\" is the event {2, 4, 6}.",
                "D": "This describes the sample space, not an event. The sample space is the universal set of all outcomes; events are subsets of it."

                "B": "Correct! The non-negativity axiom states that for any event A, P(A) ≥ 0. Probabilities cannot be negative, which aligns with our intuition about measuring likelihood.",
