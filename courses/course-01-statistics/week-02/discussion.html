            <h1>Week 2 Discussion Topics</h1>
            <p>Explore how random variables and probability distributions are used in machine learning and AI systems.
            </p>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 1: The Ubiquity of the Normal Distribution</h4>
                <p>The Normal (Gaussian) distribution appears everywhere in nature and machine learning—from measurement
                    errors to weight initializations in neural networks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why do so many real-world phenomena follow approximately Normal distributions? (Hint: Think
                        about the Central Limit Theorem, which we'll cover in Week 6)</li>
                    <li>When might assuming Normality be dangerous or inappropriate in ML applications?</li>
                    <li>How do neural network weight initializations (like Xavier/He initialization) leverage properties
                        of the Normal distribution?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 2: Discrete vs. Continuous in Practice</h4>
                <p>In theory, discrete and continuous random variables are distinct. In practice, the line often blurs.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital computers represent all numbers discretely. Does this mean there's no such thing as a
                        truly continuous random variable in computational practice?</li>
                    <li>When might you model inherently discrete data (like counts) with continuous distributions? What
                        are the trade-offs?</li>
                    <li>How do generative AI models (like diffusion models) handle the transition between discrete
                        tokens and continuous representations?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 3: Choosing the Right Distribution</h4>
                <p>Selecting an appropriate distribution to model data is a critical skill in applied statistics and ML.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What criteria would you use to select between Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated
                        Poisson for count data?</li>
                    <li>In machine learning, we often use specific distributions for specific tasks (Bernoulli for
                        binary classification, Categorical for multi-class). Why do these choices matter?</li>
                    <li>How might misspecifying the distribution affect an ML model's predictions and uncertainty
                        estimates?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Topic 4: The Role of CDFs in ML</h4>
                <p>While PDFs and PMFs get more attention, CDFs have important applications in ML and statistics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How are CDFs used in goodness-of-fit tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test?</li>
                    <li>Quantile regression predicts conditional quantiles rather than means. How does this relate to
                        the CDF, and when might it be preferable to standard regression?</li>
                    <li>The inverse CDF (quantile function) is crucial for sampling. Explain how you would generate
                        samples from any distribution given only its CDF.</li>
                </ul>
