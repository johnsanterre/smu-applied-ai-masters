            <p>Test your understanding of random variables, probability mass/density functions, and common
                distributions.</p>

                "A": "A PMF value P(X=x) directly gives the probability of that specific value. A PDF value f(x) is a density, not a probability—you need to integrate to get probabilities.",
                "B": "Correct! For continuous random variables, the probability of any single exact value is zero: P(X = x) = 0. We can only assign non-zero probabilities to intervals. The PDF gives a density that must be integrated over an interval to yield probability.",
                "C": "Both PMF and PDF are always non-negative. For PMF, values sum to 1; for PDF, the integral over all values equals 1.",
                "D": "Both are ways to describe probability distributions. A PMF is for discrete variables; a PDF is for continuous variables. They serve analogous purposes in their respective domains."

                    <li class="quiz-option" data-value="A">PMF values are probabilities; PDF values must be integrated
                        to get probabilities</li>
                    <li class="quiz-option" data-value="B">For a PDF, P(X = x) = 0 for any specific value x; for a PMF,
                        P(X = x) can be positive</li>
                    <li class="quiz-option" data-value="C">PMF can be negative while PDF must be non-negative</li>
                    <li class="quiz-option" data-value="D">PDF describes random variables; PMF describes deterministic
                        outcomes</li>

                "C": "Correct! The Exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process. It has the memoryless property: the probability of waiting another t minutes is the same regardless of how long you have already waited.",
                "D": "The Poisson distribution counts the number of events in a fixed interval, not the time between events. However, if arrivals follow a Poisson process, the time between arrivals is Exponential."

                <h4>Question 2: Customer arrivals at a store follow a Poisson process. Which distribution models the
                    time between consecutive arrivals?</h4>

                "B": "0.7 is F(2) = P(X ≤ 2), which is the probability X is less than or equal to 2, not greater than 2.",
                "C": "There is no reason to halve the value. The complement relationship gives us the direct answer.",
                "D": "0.5 would be correct if the median were at 2 for a symmetric distribution, but we are given F(2) = 0.7, so the calculation is straightforward."

                "C": "The PDF does not need to be bounded; it can be unbounded (like the Normal PDF as we approach its peak for very small variance). What matters is the integral equals 1.",
