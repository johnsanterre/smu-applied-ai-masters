                "C": "Correct! The p-value is the probability of observing data as extreme as (or more extreme than) what was observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. It measures how surprising the data is under H₀.",
                "D": "A small p-value does not prove the alternative is true; it simply suggests the data is unlikely under H₀."
            }'>
                <h4>Question 1: A p-value of 0.03 means:</h4>
