            <h1>Programming Glossary</h1>
            <p>Essential terminology for Python programming and computational thinking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-2">
            <h2>Core Programming Concepts</h2>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Algorithm</h4>
                <p>A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Algorithms are the foundation of computational
                    thinking—they transform inputs into outputs through a defined sequence of operations. In AI,
                    algorithms range from simple sorting to complex neural network training procedures.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Variable</h4>
                <p>A named storage location for data. Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning their type is
                    determined at runtime. They act as labels pointing to objects in memory, enabling code to work with
                    data abstractly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Data Type</h4>
                <p>A classification that specifies what kind of value a variable holds (int, float, str, bool, etc.).
                    Data types determine what operations are valid and how values are stored in memory.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions accept inputs (parameters), process
                    them, and optionally return outputs. They enable modular, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) programming.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Control Flow</h4>
                <p>The order in which statements execute. Control structures (if/else, loops) allow branching and
                    repetition, enabling programs to make decisions and process collections of data.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-2">
            <h2>Data Structures</h2>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>List</h4>
                <p>An ordered, mutable collection of items. Lists support indexing, slicing, and various methods
                    (append, pop, sort). They are Python's workhorse for sequential data storage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Tuple</h4>
                <p>An ordered, immutable collection. Tuples are faster than lists and used for fixed collections of
                    items. Their immutability makes them hashable and usable as dictionary keys.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Dictionary</h4>
                <p>An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries provide O(1) average-case lookup by key,
                    making them ideal for mappings and caching. They are implemented as hash tables.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Set</h4>
                <p>An unordered collection of unique elements. Sets support mathematical operations (union,
                    intersection, difference) and provide O(1) membership testing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Array (NumPy)</h4>
                <p>A fixed-type, multidimensional container optimized for numerical operations. NumPy arrays enable
                    vectorized operations that are orders of magnitude faster than Python loops.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>DataFrame (Pandas)</h4>
                <p>A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. DataFrames are
                    the primary tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-2">
            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Class</h4>
                <p>A blueprint for creating objects. Classes define attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that their
                    instances will have. They enable code organization and reuse through inheritance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Object</h4>
                <p>An instance of a class. Objects combine state (attribute values) and behavior (methods). In Python,
                    everything is an object, including functions and classes themselves.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>A mechanism where a class (child) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent).
                    Inheritance enables code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships between types.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, while hiding internal
                    implementation details. Python uses naming conventions (_private, __name_mangling) for
                    encapsulation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>The ability of different classes to be treated through the same interface. In Python, duck typing
                    enables polymorphism: "if it walks like a duck, it's a duck."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-2">
            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>A system for tracking changes to code over time. Git is the standard, enabling collaboration,
                    branching, and rollback. Essential for any professional development workflow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Unit Test</h4>
                <p>A test that verifies a small, isolated piece of code (typically a function) works correctly. Unit
                    tests form the foundation of test-driven development and continuous integration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Debugging</h4>
                <p>The process of finding and fixing errors in code. Techniques include print statements, interactive
                    debuggers (pdb), and systematic hypothesis testing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Exception</h4>
                <p>An error that occurs during execution. Python's try/except mechanism allows graceful error handling,
                    preventing crashes and enabling recovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Refactoring</h4>
                <p>Restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. Goals include improving
                    readability, reducing complexity, and enhancing maintainability.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-2">
            <h2>Algorithm Analysis</h2>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Big-O Notation</h4>
                <p>A mathematical notation describing the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. O(n)
                    means linear scaling; O(n²) means quadratic. Critical for choosing efficient algorithms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Time Complexity</h4>
                <p>How the runtime of an algorithm scales with input size. Understanding time complexity helps predict
                    performance and avoid bottlenecks in data-intensive applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="glossary-term">
                <h4>Space Complexity</h4>
                <p>How memory usage scales with input size. Important when working with large datasets or
                    memory-constrained environments.</p>
