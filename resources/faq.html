                <h4>How long does it take to complete the program?</h4>
                <p>The program consists of 10 courses. Full-time students typically complete the program in 2 years,
                    while part-time students may take 3-4 years.</p>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Are there prerequisite requirements?</h4>
                <p>Students should have a bachelor's degree and basic familiarity with mathematics. The Foundation Phase
                    courses (1-3) are designed to establish the necessary technical background.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-topic">
                <h4>Can I take courses out of order?</h4>
                <p>Courses are designed to build upon each other. We recommend following the sequence, especially within
                    each phase. Some flexibility exists with advisor approval.</p>
